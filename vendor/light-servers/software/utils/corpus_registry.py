"""The single seam through which every Light* app reads its corpus.

Two invariants carry the whole design. Both are structural: they are enforced
by what this module *is*, not by what contributors remember to do.

I1 -- THE CACHE HOLDS ONLY STRINGS, never a parsed object.
    ``load()`` is ``yaml.safe_load(cached_text)``, so every call allocates a
    fresh object graph. There is nothing shared to leak between sessions, so
    there is no ``deepcopy`` to forget and no shallow-copy trap. This is
    strictly stronger than "deep-copy on read": a deepcopy rule is one a
    future contributor can violate, whereas there is simply no object in the
    cache to hand out. Testable in one line -- every value is a ``str``.

Extra world data reaches a task through its own world overlay
(``COMPLEXMCP_WORLD_DATA``), applied by ``software/utils/world_data.py``.
This module only ever reads the app's shipped corpus.

This module has no write path. Not "we don't call it" -- the function is not
written. The only serialisation here is ``yaml.safe_dump`` to a *string* for
the cache; nothing in this file opens a file for writing.
