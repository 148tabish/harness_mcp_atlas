"""Seedless world snapshots.

Freeze a session's *generated* world so it can be loaded verbatim at login
instead of being rolled from a seed (ETOM-style: the world is read, not rolled).

Why pickle rather than hand-written JSON per app: a session's world is an
arbitrary object graph — typed dataclasses, nested lists/dicts, a `random.Random`
that is *shared* by reference with helpers like `TimeMachine`. Pickle preserves
that graph, including the shared-rng identity and the exact post-generation rng
state, so runtime id/timestamp/network minting reproduces the seeded sequence
byte-for-byte. One utility works for all ~140 apps; no per-app serializer.

Use: bake_session(core_session, path) to freeze a session, and
restore_into(self, path) to load it (pickle never calls __init__).

Seed vs. content, two different guarantees:
  `resolve_seed()` below always drives `self.rng`, so ids/timestamps/minted
  values are reproducible for a given seed.
  That is NOT the same as "content varies by seed" -- ~102 of 138 apps load
  their substantive content (listings, tickets, messages, ...) from a static
  per-app corpus that a seed change never touches; only ~36 apps' content
  actually differs across seeds. See software/utils/seed_content_registry.py
  for the empirically-derived per-app answer. Each app's authored world
  lives in-code -- baked into software/<App>/corpus/*.yaml where the corpus can
  hold it, else in software/<App>/world.json (both loaded via world_data at
  boot). For task authors who need *different* content for a seed-static app,
  the mechanism is a software.utils.world_data override dir or
  software.utils.fixtures, not seed.

# What a world snapshot is allowed to construct.
#
# Two layers guard this file and they fail independently. _verify_snapshot
# checks that a snapshot's bytes are the recorded ones, and the manifest it
# checks against is rewritten by _record_snapshot on every bake, so a writer
# who can replace a .pkl can also replace its digest in the same commit. That
# layer therefore assumes the writer is honest. This one does not: it bounds
# what a snapshot can construct even when its digest checks out, which is what
# actually closes the arbitrary-code-execution channel unpickling opens.
#
# The rule is by module origin rather than by class name. A snapshot holds an
# arbitrary object graph of the app's own dataclasses, so enumerating class
# names would need editing every time an app gains a field type, and would
# fail at load time rather than review time when someone forgot. Origin is
# the property that actually matters: a class defined by this repository's own
# world model is fine, and `os.system` or `subprocess.Popen` is not, whatever
# either is called.
# Builtins are enumerated one by one rather than allowed as a module, because
# `builtins` is where the classic pickle escapes live. Every name here is an
# inert container or scalar type. `eval`, `exec`, `open`, `getattr`,
# `__import__`, and `type` are deliberately absent: the first five are the
# standard gadget set, and `type` would let a payload build new classes.
