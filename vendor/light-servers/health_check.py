"""Probe every light-server in the fleet and report readiness, one line each.

entrypoint.sh launches its servers as background processes and then `wait`s.
Without a probe, a server that died on import looks exactly like one serving
happily until an agent's tool call fails mid-trajectory.

This runs in the foreground after the launch loop, polls each port until it
accepts a connection, prints one line per server, and exits.

EVERY SERVER IN THE TABLE IS LISTED, not just the ones this task enabled. A
task typically starts a handful of the 161 and leaves the rest alone, so
most lines on a healthy run read DOWN. That is expected and is why the two
groups are reported separately: a DOWN server the task never asked for is
inventory, and a DOWN server the task DECLARED is a broken run. Only the
second kind sets the exit code -- otherwise every normal run would exit 1 and
the code would carry no information at all.

WHY THE PORT MAP IS PARSED, NOT COPIED. Every port lives in exactly one place:
the `SERVER_CMDS` table in entrypoint.sh. A second copy here would be correct
would drift the first time a server moved, so this parses the same table the
launcher uses.

WHY THE TWO GROUPS GET DIFFERENT DEADLINES. Enabled servers are still booting
when this starts, so they are retried on a deadline that scales with how many
were launched -- a fixed 10s budget reports 0/161 DOWN on a fleet that is
merely slow, which is worse than no log because it is confidently wrong.
Servers that were never launched cannot come up no matter how long we wait, so
they get a single pass. Retrying them would add ~13 minutes to every run to
re-confirm a foregone conclusion.

WHAT A PASS ACTUALLY MEANS. A TCP connect proves a process is listening on the
port. It does not prove the server completes an MCP handshake or that its world
loaded. That is the honest limit of a socket probe, and it is still the
difference between "the process is up" and "the process died on import", which
is the failure this exists to catch.

WHY RESULTS ARE WRITTEN INCREMENTALLY. The probe file is written line-by-line
as each future completes (via as_completed) rather than batch-flushed at the
end. This ensures partial results survive a SIGTERM: when docker-compose tears
down the container after the agent run, whatever servers had already responded
are recorded. Servers still being retried at teardown time are simply absent
from the probe file.

Env:
    ENABLED_SERVERS   comma-separated subset, the same variable entrypoint.sh
                      reads. Unset means every server was launched.
    HEALTH_DEADLINE   seconds to keep retrying enabled servers
                      (default: 30 + 5*n, max 900). Set 0 for a single pass.
    HEALTH_INTERVAL   seconds between attempts (default 2.0)
    HEALTH_TIMEOUT    per-connect timeout in seconds (default 1.0)
    HEALTH_ENTRYPOINT path to entrypoint.sh (default /app/entrypoint.sh)
    HEALTH_LOG        file to tee the report into
                      (default /var/log/light-servers/health.log)

Exit 0 if every ENABLED server is UP, 1 if any enabled server is DOWN.
